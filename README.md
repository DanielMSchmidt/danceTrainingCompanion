# Dance Training Companion

## Vision

An offline-first application, which lets you build relationships between one or many of the following:

- dancing instruction
- danced figure
- point of time in the choreography

## Server

Should be done via a slim rails api

## Frontend

- Normal yeoman webapp with React + Backbone (+ Marionette)
- tests would be really cool
